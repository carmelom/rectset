Analytical potentials for rectangle electrodes in a surface ion trap

---

This package provides numpy functions to calculate analytically the electric potential, gradient, and hessian generated by a rectangular electrode in the upper half-space above it.

## API

`rectangle_electrode.py`

Static potential by a rectangle electrode of finite size delimited by corner points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, set at a potential of 1 V.

`pseudopotential.py`

Static potential of a pair of electrodes infinitely extended along $x$, and pseudopotential generated by an AC voltage of amplitude 1 V, frequency of 1 MHz, for a particle of 1 elementary charge and 1 atomic mass.

## Dependencies

`numpy`
